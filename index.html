            Hi, I'm Leo. One bright and sunny morning, I decided to go on an adventure. I had always wanted to explore the big park near my house. So I thought, 'Why not today?'. I packed a small bag with my favourite snacks, a sandwich, and an apple and grabbed a bottle of water. I set out on my adventure with a big smile, feeling excited.<br><br>
            The park was huge and full of surprises. Tall trees seemed to touch the sky and colorful flowers were everywhere. I heard birds singing and saw squirrels playing. It was like being in a storybook. I walked along the paths, deeper into the park, enjoying every moment. But after a while, I stopped and looked around. The paths looked different. The trees seemed unfamiliar. I had wandered off the main path and now didn't know where I was. A little worry crept into my heart.<br><br>
            I sat down on a nearby bench to think. 'I can figure this out,' I told myself. I tried to remember the way I came. Then, I thought about the sun. It rises in the east and sets in the west. So, if I followed the sun, it could guide me back. With this plan, I started walking, paying attention to the sun and the surroundings. Eventually, I recognized a part of the park near my house â€“ the playground where I often played.<br><br>
            As I walked out of the park, I felt relieved and happy. I had found my way back all by myself. When I got home, I shared my adventure with my family. They were happy to see me and proud of my bravery. I learned a lot that day. I learned that it's fun to explore and see new things, but it's also important to stay calm and think when things don't go as planned. My adventure in the park was something I would always remember.
